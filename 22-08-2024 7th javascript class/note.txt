Function:
* Named block of instructions which is used to perform a specific task.
* function gets executed  only when ity is called .
* the main advantage of function is , we can achive code reuseabvility.
* MAIN PURPOSE: code reuseability ,which means code once declared can be called anywhere.

Note.

*Syntax to create a function.
*Generally we can create a function in 2 ways:
1. using function decalration statement(function statement)
2.function expression.


1> FUNCTION DECLARATION STATEMENT:

finction indentifier(parameter1,parameter2,.....)
{
    statement
}

Note:

* name of function is variable which holds the referance of function object.
* createing a function using function statement supports function

*****hoisting.therefore we can also use a function before function decalration

* ex:
   console.log('start');
   console.log(test);
   function test()
   {
    console.log("hello")
   }
   console.log("end")


*When we try to log the function name the entire function defination is printed.

*To call a function:
*function_name('argument list'); -----function calling statement;

PARAMETERS:
-----------
* the variables declared in the function defination/decalration is known as parameter.
* the parameters have local scope.Those can be used inside the function body
* PARAMETERS are used to hold the values passed by a calling a function.

EX:
function sum(a,b)
